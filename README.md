# MULTI_STEP_FORM
A modern multi-step form with a dashboard UI, featuring personal info, account setup, profile details, and review steps. Includes password validation, dark mode toggle, animated success modal, and localStorage. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
This is a modern, multi-step form application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for user registration with a sleek, dashboard-style interface. It features four steps: Personal Information, Account Setup, Profile Details, and Review & Submit, each clearly labeled in a responsive progress bar. The form ensures robust input validation, including a strong password requirement (letters, numbers, special characters) with a dynamic strength meter.  Key features include: - **Aesthetic Design**: Uses Poppins font, a fixed gradient background (light: blue-purple, dark: navy-dark), and a card-like dashboard with frosted glass effect, shadows, and rounded corners. Smooth transitions and gradient buttons enhance UX. - **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with sun (‚òÄÔ∏è) and moon (üåô) icons, with theme persistence via localStorage. - **Interactive Elements**: Animated buttons (Next, Previous, Submit), skills tagging system, profile picture preview, and bio character counter. - **Success Modal**: A visually appealing, animated "Submission Successful" overlay with a green checkmark and "Start Over" button. - **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation (Tab key) and responsive design for mobile devices. - **Data Persistence**: Form data is saved in localStorage, auto-loaded on page refresh, and cleared on submission or restart.  The JavaScript code is well-commented, handling step navigation, validation, and dynamic updates like review data display. CSS includes modern animations (e.g., form step fade-in, success modal scale) and a cohesive color scheme (e.g., #2a9d8f for success). The project is ideal for user onboarding, registration, or profile creation, with a focus on usability and visual appeal.  To run, open `index.html` in a browser (Live Server recommended) with an internet connection for Google Fonts. All files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are ready for deployment on GitHub.
